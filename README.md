# Rosenbrock Steepest Descent (Vibe Coding Experiment)

This repository contains a short Python program that converges to the minimum of the **Rosenbrock function** using the **steepest gradient (gradient descent)** method with Armijo backtracking.

I originally implemented the same algorithm in **MATLAB** for a graduate class, but here I wanted to “vibe code” it from scratch in Python to get a feel for lightweight numerical experimentation outside of MATLAB.  I used ChatGPT 5 for everything in this project and just intended to use it to get more introduced to different tools I didn't utilize when I originally took the optimization course.

## Files
- `rosenbrock_steepest_descent.py` – main optimization script  
- `rosenbrock_path.png` – example contour plot showing the optimization path

## Run
```bash
python rosenbrock_steepest_descent.py
